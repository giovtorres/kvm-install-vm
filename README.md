## kvm-install-vm

A bash wrapper around virt-install to build virtual machines on a local KVM
hypervisor.  You can run it as a normal user which will use `qemu:///session` to
connect locally to your KVM domains.

Tested on the latest Fedora.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the KVM hypervisor installed, along with a few other packages:

- genisoimage or mkisofs
- virt-install
- libguestfs-tools-c
- qemu-img
- libvirt-client

To install the dependencies, run:

```
sudo dnf -y install genisoimage virt-install libguestfs-tools-c qemu-img libvirt-client wget
```

If you want to resolve guests by their hostnames, install the `libvirt-nss` package:

```
sudo dnf -y install libvirt-nss
```

Then, add `libvirt` and `libvirt_guest` to list of **hosts** databases in
`/etc/nsswitch.conf`.  See [here](https://libvirt.org/nss.html) for more
information.

```
$ kvm-install-vm help attach-disk
NAME
    kvm-install-vm attach-disk [OPTIONS] [COMMANDS] VMNAME

DESCRIPTION
    Attaches a new disk to a guest domain.

COMMANDS
    help - show this help

OPTIONS
    -d SIZE     Disk size (GB)
    -f FORMAT   Disk image format       (default: qcow2)
    -s IMAGE    Source of disk device

        Attach a 10GB disk device named example-5g.qcow2 to the foo guest
        domain.
```

### Setting Custom Defaults

Copy the `.kivrc` file to your $HOME directory to set custom defaults.  This is
convenient if you find yourself repeatedly setting the same options on the
command line, like the distribution or the number of vCPUs.

Options are evaluated in the following order:

- Default options set in the script
- Custom options set in `.kivrc`
- Option flags set on the command line

### Notes

1. This script will download a qcow2 cloud image from the respective
   distribution's download site.  See script for URLs.

2. If using libvirt-nss, keep in mind that DHCP leases take some time to
   expire, so if you create a VM, delete it, and recreate another VM with the
   same name in a short period of time, there will be two DHCP leases for the
   same host and its hostname will likely not resolve until the old lease
   expires.

### Testing

Tests are written using [Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats).  To
execute the tests, run `./test.sh` in the root directory of the project.

### Use Cases

If you don't need to use Docker or Vagrant, don't want to make changes to a
production machine, or just want to spin up one or more VMs locally to test
things like:

- high availability
- clustering
- package installs
- preparing for exams
- checking for system defaults
- anything else you would do with a VM

...then this wrapper could be useful for you.
